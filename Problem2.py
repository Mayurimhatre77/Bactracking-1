#In this code, I implemented a function addOperators to find all possible ways to add binary operators (+, -, *) between the digits of a given string num such that the resultant expression evaluates to a given target value. Using a helper function backTrack, I performed a depth-first search (DFS) through the string, keeping track of the current index, the previous operand (pre), the current operand (curr), the cumulative value (value), and the expression string (s). If the entire string is processed (index == n) and the cumulative value equals the target with no remaining current operand, the expression is added to the results list (ans). At each step, I explored continuing the current number, adding a new number with a +, -, or * operator, and handled the new cumulative value and previous operand accordingly. The function starts with initializing the length of num (n) and the result list (ans), then calls the backTrack function. Finally, it returns the list of valid expressions. The time complexity is O(4^n) due to the exponential growth in exploring all combinations of operators and digits, and the space complexity is O(n) for the recursion stack and the space needed to store the results.

class Solution:
    def addOperators(self, num: str, target: int) -> List[str]:
        def backTrack(index,pre,curr,value,s):
            if index == n:
                if value == target and curr == 0:
                    ans.append(s)
                return
            curr = curr * 10 + int(num[index])

            if curr > 0:
                backTrack(index + 1,pre,curr,value,s)

            if not s:
                backTrack(index + 1,curr,0,value+curr,str(curr))
            else:
                backTrack(index + 1,curr,0,value+curr,s+"+"+str(curr))
                backTrack(index + 1,-curr,0,value-curr,s+"-"+str(curr))
                backTrack(index + 1,pre*curr,0,value-pre+pre*curr,s+"*"+str(curr))

        n = len(num)
        ans = []
        backTrack(0,0,0,0,"")
        return ans
